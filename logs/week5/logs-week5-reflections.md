# WeekÂ 5 Reflection Template

## Weekly Reflection

## What went well?

This week was exceptionally productive with major achievements in theme development and professional development. The LSX Demo Theme standardization project was a significant success, involving comprehensive updates to theme.json with standardized color, spacing, and typography token systems. The migration from legacy named font size slugs to a unified numeric scale (100-900) was well executed, including implementation of guard scripts to prevent future legacy usage. Successfully completed the Ollie Block Academy Course at 100%, which enhanced my WordPress block development capabilities. Client work diversification went smoothly with successful onboarding to both Xneelo and T4A projects, including VPN configuration and familiarization with new systems. The Xneelo handover meetings with Justin and Lourens established clear communication channels and project understanding. Accessibility improvements were substantial, implementing WCAG AA compliance measures, contrast validation reports, and creating a custom contrast calculator for theme colors. Regular team collaboration with Ash, Brandon, Seren, and Barbara maintained project momentum and knowledge sharing.

## What can be improved?

While the week was highly productive, time management across multiple client projects could be optimized.

## What have you learned?

This week significantly advanced my WordPress theme development expertise, particularly in design system implementation and token-based architecture. I achieved the creation and implementation of standardized color palettes with semantic, neutral, and accent scales, understanding how WordPress handles CSS custom properties for theme consistency. Accessibility compliance became much clearer through hands-on WCAG AA implementation, including contrast ratio calculations and validation processes. GitHub Copilot course progress enhanced my understanding of AI-assisted development workflows and code generation strategies. PHP hooks documentation refresh strengthened my WordPress development knowledge. Understand the CodRabbit and copilot sinergy helped me a lot in the LSX Demo Theme Update theme.json task.

## What are your next actions?

-   Xneelo - More Handover sessions with Justin.
-   Xneelo - Start working on small tasks to familiarize myself with the site, and how the team works.
-   Personal project - Keep transforming the site with the new guides Ash gave me and apply the new standardized colour, spacing, and typography token system.
-   Continue my studies on Accelerate App Development Using GitHub Copilot course.
-   Continue yhe support on Clients tickets.
