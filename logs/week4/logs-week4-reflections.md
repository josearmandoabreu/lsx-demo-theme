# Week 04 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week demonstrated excellent progress across multiple fronts, with strong momentum in both personal project development and client work. The completion of personal project Phase 3 (Styling & Global Settings) was a significant achievement, successfully implementing mobile menus, fixing responsive design issues, and enhancing global styles through theme.json modifications. GitHub Foundations Part 2 progressed steadily with completion of modules 1-7, including challenging exercises that deepened understanding of version control workflows. Bug resolution was particularly effective, successfully solving multiple Bugherd tickets (#22, #23, #36, #37). Regular team meetings with Barbara, Lourens, Brandon, and Seren provided valuable guidance and maintained project alignment. The integration of Ollie theme patterns and exploration of WordPress development tools expanded technical capabilities significantly.

### What can be improved?

Balancing the intensive focus on personal project development with other learning objectives required careful time management that could be optimized further.

### What have you learned?

This week advanced my WordPress theme development skills, particularly in mobile-responsive design and theme.json configuration. I gained hands-on experience with the Ollie theme's pattern system and learned how to effectively integrate external theme components into custom projects. GitHub workflow proficiency increased substantially through practical application of pull requests, merging changes, and repository management. Regular team collaboration reinforced the importance of communication and knowledge sharing in project success.

### What are your next actions?

-   Complete the remaining 5 sections of the Ollie Block Academy Course to fully utilize pattern development capabilities.
-   Continue advancing personal project focus on blog page enhancements and responsive design optimization.
-   Implement the new page templates with sidebar and alternative post templates as outlined in the Template Registration Checklist.
-   Next week I wil start the Xneelo Handover with Justin.
