# WeekÂ 02 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week, I completed several Microsoft and GitHub courses, which helped me deepen my understanding of repository management, GitHub Copilot, and best practices for maintaining secure repositories. I made a solid progress on my personal project adding real content and styles based on the document I made (Website Design & Content Planning - Jose's Gaming Website) Using Copilot.

### What can be improved?

Managing priorities is sometimes difficult, I need to Improve on that front.

### What have you learned?

I learned how to use advanced GitHub Copilot features, manage repositories effectively, and maintain secure repositories. Also learned how to use better prompts to maximize Copilot help.

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue working on my personal project.
-   finish the GitHub Foundations, Part 1 course.
-   Support the Interns.
