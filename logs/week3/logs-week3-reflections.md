# WeekÂ 03 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week was incredibly productive and insightful. I aclomplished more on my personal project and help debugging The main Lightspeed Demo theme respository.

### What can be improved?

Try to complete more study hours during the week apart from the documentation.

### What have you learned?

Being able to listen and help the interns unblock some aspects of their work and task management made me feel good and discovered that I have the ability to support them and any other member of the team beyond my personal assignments.

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue working on my personal project.
-   I will probably start working on some clients tickets and support Lourens and Barbara.
-   Continue my leaning path.
