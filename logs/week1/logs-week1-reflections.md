# WeekÂ 01 Log and Reflection

## Weekly Reflection

### What went well?

This week, I successfully set up all required profiles and accounts, completed the Personal project - Phase 1 and started Personal project - Phase 2, Rear some Github documentations (LightSpeed guides for branching and PR structures) that are very important to align myself with the company workflow.

### What can be improved?

The Block Theme Academy course required more time and focus than I initially anticipated. I could improve my time management by allocating more focused blocks of time for complex tasks. Additionally, I could streamline the process of taking notes to make it more efficient.

### What have you learned?

I learned how to set up and secure various accounts, work with Local Ollie and LSX-Demo Site, and navigate the Block Theme Academy course..

### What are your next actions?

-   Continue exploring advanced topics in block themes.
-   Start GitHub & Copilot Learning Paths .
-   Continue with My personal project next phases.
-   Explore additional resources and communities to deepen my understanding of WordPress themes and Github.
