# **Fish Custom Post Type**

About the _types of fish Brandon fishes for_ (rather than each individual catch), then the structure can be much simpler and more “guide-like.” Here’s a streamlined definition:

---

## **🎣 Custom Post Type: Fish**

Each entry = **one fish species/type** (e.g., Smallmouth Yellowfish, Tigerfish, Largemouth Bass).
This will be more like a **field guide** than a logbook.

---

## **📝 Suggested Fields for Single Fish Template**

-   **Featured Image** — large header image of the species.
-   **Gallery** — optional, e.g., habitat shots or multiple angles.
-   **Description** — main body text about the fish.
-   **Habitat / Locations** (text or taxonomy, e.g., Huttenspruit, Tugela River, Drakensberg streams).
-   **Fishing Season** — when it’s best to catch this species.
-   **Bait / Techniques** — recommended bait or fishing methods.
-   **Conservation Status** — optional, e.g., endangered, common.
-   **Brandon’s Notes** — personal anecdotes or tips.

## **🎨 Layout for Single Fish Template**

1. **Hero Section**: Featured image + species name.
2. **Key Facts Section**: Habitat, season, bait, conservation status.
3. **Description Section**: Full write-up about the species.
4. **Gallery Section**: Optional images of the fish in its habitat.
5. **Related Species Section**: Links to other fish in the same taxonomy.

## **📂 Taxonomies**

-   **Species Group** (e.g., Yellowfish, Bass, Tilapia).
-   **Location** (e.g., Huttenspruit, Tugela River, Drakensberg streams).

## **🧪 Testing the CPT**

-   Ensure the CPT is accessible via `/fish/{fish-slug}/`.
-   Test the archive layout (`/fish/`) for usability and searchability.
-   Verify that all fields render correctly in the single template.
