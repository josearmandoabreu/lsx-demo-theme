# **Tagline \+ logo brief update**

Here’s a refined **tagline \+ logo brief update** for Brandon’s project:

---

## **🎣 Suggested Tagline**

**“Stories from the river, catches for a lifetime.”**

This tagline ties together the **personal storytelling** (blog posts), the **fish guide content** (CPT), and the idea that each fishing adventure leaves a memory. It’s warm, human, and matches the tone you defined earlier.

## **🔖 Logo Brief Update with Tagline**

-   **Primary lockup:** “Brandon’s Fishing Adventures” with fish illustration.

-   **Tagline beneath:** “Stories from the river, catches for a lifetime.”

-   **Style:** Natural, friendly, earthy tones (river blues, muted greens, warm greys).

-   **Typography:** Bold sans-serif for the main name; lighter sans-serif for the tagline.

-   **Deliverables:** Full logo with tagline, secondary logo without tagline, monochrome version.

---

### **Testing the Tagline**

-   Share the tagline with a small audience (friends, fishing community) to ensure it resonates.
-   Test the tagline in different contexts (e.g., website header, social media bio, print materials).

---

I’ve generated a **new logo concept** that includes the tagline. You now have:

-   The **main brand name** (Brandon’s Fishing Adventures).

-   The **tagline** beneath in smaller, lighter type.

-   A **fish illustration with line/hook** to carry the fishing theme.

-   A **natural colour palette** aligned with the KwaZulu-Natal riverscape.
