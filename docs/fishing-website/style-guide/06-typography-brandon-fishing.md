# **Typography**

**Google Fonts typography breakdown** tailored for Brandon’s Fishing Adventures site. It balances friendliness, readability, and a natural, outdoors-inspired vibe.

## **1\. Headings (H1–H3)**

**Montserrat** (Bold / Semi-Bold)

-   Clean, geometric sans-serif with a modern but approachable feel.

-   Works well for strong headlines like _“Smallmouth Yellowfish”_ or _“Fishing Adventures in KZN”_.

-   Keeps the site adventurous yet professional.

Alternative: **Raleway** (slightly more elegant, softer personality).

---

## **2\. Body Text (Paragraphs, Blog Content)**

**Lora** (Regular / Italic)

-   Warm, humanist serif that’s easy to read in longer paragraphs.

-   Adds a touch of personality and storytelling character, perfect for Brandon’s blog-style writing.

-   Italics can be used for anecdotes, fish species names, or quotes.

Alternative: **Merriweather** (slightly darker tone, very readable on screen).

## **3\. Navigation, Captions, Microcopy**

**Open Sans** (Regular / Medium)

-   Neutral and highly legible.

-   Great for menus, buttons, forms, and small UI text.

-   Provides balance against the personality of Montserrat and Lora.

Alternative: **Work Sans** (friendly, a bit more rounded).
