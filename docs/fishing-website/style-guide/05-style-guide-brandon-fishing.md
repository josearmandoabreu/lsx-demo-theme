# **🎣 Brandon’s Fishing Adventures – Style Guide**

Here’s how you could define Brandon’s **colours, typography, and style** for the fishing website, rooted in the Huttenspruit/KwaZulu-Natal context:

---

## **🎨 Colours**

Pick a palette from the natural environment:

-   **River & Water:** muted deep blue or green-blue (for headings/accents).

-   **Rocks & Sand:** warm greys and sandy beige (for backgrounds and dividers).

-   **Vegetation:** olive or muted green (secondary accents, hover states).

-   **Sunset/Adventure:** a touch of burnt orange or ochre (CTA buttons, highlights).

Keep it earthy, not glossy — echoing the real outdoor setting.

---

## **✍️ Typography**

-   **Headings:** bold, modern sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat, Inter, or Source Sans). Clean, easy to read.

-   **Body text:** humanist sans-serif or a serif with warmth (e.g., Lora, Merriweather). Comfortable for longer reading.

-   **Accents/Quotes:** italic serif or lighter weight for storytelling vibe.

### **Hierarchy**

-   **H1:** adventurous tone (“Catch the story. Relive the moment.”).
-   **H2/H3:** straightforward, informative.
-   **Paragraphs:** short, easy to scan.

---

## **🖼️ Imagery**

-   Use **high-quality, natural photos** that reflect the rivers and fish of KwaZulu-Natal.
-   Include **alt text** for every image to ensure accessibility.
-   Maintain consistent dimensions for featured images (e.g., 1200x800px).

---

## **🖌️ Style Rules**

-   **Buttons:** Rounded corners, hover states with subtle color shifts.
-   **Dividers:** Thin, muted lines (e.g., `#D9D3C7`).
-   **Icons:** Simple, line-based, nature-inspired (e.g., fish, hooks, rivers).

---

## **🧪 Testing Style Consistency**

-   Test the design on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
-   Use tools like **Lighthouse** to ensure accessibility and performance.
-   Check for consistent use of colors, typography, and spacing across all pages.
