## **📣 Voice & Tone (recap, page by page)**

-   **Homepage:** energetic, passionate, adventurous.

-   **About:** personal storytelling, first-person perspective, “this is my journey.”

-   **Fish (CPT archive):** clear, informative, visual; almost like a guidebook.

-   **Blog:** casual, conversational, friendly — Brandon talking to a mate.

-   **Contact:** short, human, “Drop me a note, I’ll get back soon.”

## **⚖️ Style Rules & Tone Sliders**

-   ZA English, short sentences (8–18 words).

-   Tone sliders: **Casual, Playful, Plain, Energetic, Educational**.

    -   **Casual:** “Hey there! Let’s talk about fishing.”
    -   **Playful:** “Hooked on fishing? Let’s dive in!”
    -   **Plain:** “Fishing is a popular outdoor activity.”
    -   **Energetic:** “Get ready to explore the rivers of KZN!”
    -   **Educational:** “Yellowfish are native to South Africa’s rivers.”

-   Accessibility: high contrast for text, alt text for every fish photo.

-   SEO: write for humans, use species names naturally, descriptive slugs (`/fish/smallmouth-yellowfish/`).

👉 With this, Brandon’s site would feel **authentic, grounded in place, and welcoming**, while still structured enough for discoverability and ease of use.

### **Testing Tone Consistency**

-   Review each page to ensure the tone matches its purpose (e.g., adventurous for the homepage, friendly for the blog).
-   Use tools like Grammarly or Hemingway to check readability and tone alignment.
