## **ðŸŽ£ Logo Brief for Brandonâ€™s Fishing Adventures**

Hereâ€™s a **logo brief** you can use to guide Brandonâ€™s fishing project identity:

---

### **Purpose**

Create a **personal yet professional logo** that reflects Brandonâ€™s passion for fishing in Huttenspruit, KwaZulu-Natal. The logo should be versatile across digital and print (website, social profiles, merch, maybe even stickers).

---

### **Style & Mood**

-   **Friendly, warm, human** â€” matches Brandonâ€™s storytelling voice.
-   **Adventure-driven** â€” evokes being outdoors, riverbanks, and the excitement of fishing.
-   **Grounded in place** â€” draw inspiration from the natural colours and textures of KZN (greens, river blues, warm rock tones).
-   **Clean & simple** â€” must scale well from favicon size to banners.

---

### **Visual Elements**

-   **Fish silhouette or line art** â€” simple but recognisable.
-   **Riverscape or hook illustration** â€” optional secondary elements.
-   **Typography:** Bold sans-serif for the main name; lighter sans-serif for the tagline.

---

### **Deliverables**

-   **Primary logo:** Wordmark + fish illustration + tagline.
-   **Secondary logo:** Wordmark + fish illustration (no tagline).
-   **Icon:** Fish illustration only (for favicon/social).
-   **Monochrome version:** For black-and-white printing.

---

### **Testing the Logo**

-   Test the logo at different sizes (favicon, social media profile, full-width header).
-   Ensure the logo works on light and dark backgrounds.
-   Share drafts with a small audience for feedback.
